title: An infectious diseases hazard map for India based on mobility and transportation networks
subtitle: We propose and construct an infectious diseases hazard map for India.
---
Given the outbreak location for infectious disease, hazard map quantifies the infection risk faced by cities and towns in India. A framework consisting of a SIR metapopulation model augmented with mobility data is used to simulate the spread of infectious diseases. Despite multiple India-focused studies on this topic, very few focus on long-distance travel as the dominant mode of infection spread. Using extensive real data and estimates of air, rail, and road mobilities, a transportation and obility network of 446 Indian cities having a population higher than 1 Lakh is constructed. Based on a notion of an effective distance that incorporates mobility information, a hazard value is assigned to each city for a given outbreak location. It is shown that the effective distance, rather than the geographical distance, from the outbreak location has a linear relation with the time of arrival of infection at every city, and hence provides a better measure of risk. The estimated hazard index is also compared with real data of SARS-CoV-2 spread during the first wave in 2020 and a good agreement is seen. With better mobility data, the proposed hazard map framework can be used for any other infectious disease spread in the future.
